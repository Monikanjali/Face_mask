This project is a basic Face Mask Detection system built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It takes images from two classes—with mask and without mask—and trains a model to classify whether a person in an image is wearing a mask or not. The images are preprocessed (resized, scaled, and converted into arrays), and then passed into a CNN model made with TensorFlow/Keras. After training, the model can predict on new images by taking the image path as input. This project was created in Google Colab using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
